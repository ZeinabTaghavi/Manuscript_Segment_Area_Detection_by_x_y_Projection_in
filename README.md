# find_segment_area_by_x_y_projection_in_-handwriting_documents
# WITH A VARIABLE THRESHOLD


This code will find text areas in a handwriting image.

Algorithm based on: Projection (x_y_Projection)

Time: 2.64

Process:

1 - correct rotation to more accurately find lines
2 - find the high compression vertical area
3 - in vertical high compression areas, find all horizontal high compression areas
